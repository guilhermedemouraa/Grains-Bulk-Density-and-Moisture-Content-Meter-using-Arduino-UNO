# Low-cost grain moisture-and-bulk density sensor for yield monitors

This repository contains code in the language C to calibrate and collect data from an Arduino-based grain moisture-and-bulk density sensor for yield monitors. This project is part of my M.Sc. thesis in Agricultural Engineering at Federal University of Vicosa

### Project Abstract:
Recent advances in sensor technologies and systems automation have allowed the development of several tools to circumvent emergent challenges in agriculture, such as climate change and scarcity of groundwater. For instance, Precision Agriculture (PA) allows farmers to reduce waste and optimize resource allocation. An essential component of PA is the yield monitor, which allows generating yield maps, helping the grower to plan the next season and decide which the best management of the farmland is. In most developing countries, yield monitors are not available to local farmers because they are marketed exclusively through self-propelled harvesting machines, which are very expensive. Among the most important components of the yield monitor stand out the moisture content and the bulk density sensors, as they are crucial to guarantee an accurate estimate of the yield. The objective of this study, which is a step towards making yield data available to farmers, is to develop a system of easy replication, updating, and low cost for determining the bulk density and moisture content of grain crops. In addition, the developed system should present the potential for implementation in yield monitors of harvesters pulled by tractors. The proposed system was developed and calibrated at a laboratory scale. A set of load cells and a container of known volume were used to create the bulk density sensor. The moisture content sensor was developed based on the dielectric method. The system’s performance was validated with grains of maize and common beans, and the results showed potential for using the developed system. The total cost of the parts used to assemble the system was US$103.95, characterizing it as low cost.
